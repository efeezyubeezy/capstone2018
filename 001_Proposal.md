# 1. Overview:

### i. Theory & Ethics: "Making Knowledge Accessible"
The goal of StudyBuddy is to create both a directory and interface for users to instantly locate and connect safely with qualified private tutors in their area at any time, and at an affordable cost.

At any point in history, anywhere in the world, education exists both an essential resource to the populace and also a closely guarded tool of the aristocracy and associated governing bodies. We all know the famous idiom, "knowledge is power," and we are all familiar with the dangers of a model that equates knowledge directly to "power" as we know it. It manifests itself as de facto segregated neighborhoods, public school systems that consistently fail their students while private school tuitions escalate to astronomically higher dollar amounts, unemployment statistics that approach economic depression levels, a rising poverty line with an equally rising cost of living, a lack of economic mobility, unprecedented levels of student debt- mass produced by the university-industrial-complex that will in most cases, either be defaulted on or sentence their borrowers to a lifetime of financial duress, and the list goes on.

Education is by no means a miracle, but its impact and effects can always be miraculous. This inherent potential of an education to provide both context for existence and opportunities to make the most of it is the premise upon which warfare tactics are often built (i.e. espionage, counterespionage, "intelligence departments"), and it has often been the only real difference between what is termed "magic" and what is termed "science" (in short: magic is just science we haven't learned yet).

In exploring this dynamic, I aim to change the narrative from "knowledge is power" to "knowledge is empowerment." Knowledge does not and should not bestow upon an individual the ability or the right to wield unequal amounts of power over others, but it does and should grant one the ability and power to elevate and improve their own lives and the lives of others in a way that has very tangible effects. Know better, do better. Since the "knowledge is power" ethos of the previous few centuries has only gotten us to where we are now, we need a different model. Knowledge as power has only brought us to the point of stratifying access to education and information along class (and subsequently every other set of relevant) lines. Conversely, since nothing occurs in a vacuum, a model of knowledge as empowerment absolutely must come with the condition that knowledge is accessible- bringing us to my macro-level goal and motto: "make knowledge accessible!"

In the real world, and on the ground level: No one cares how smart you are if they can't understand what you're saying. And if you can't explain your knowledge so people can understand and learn from it, then how smart are you really? It's not what we know that is important, but what we do with that knowledge and how we apply it.
